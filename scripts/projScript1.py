Inspired by the sites travelbydrone.com and travelwithdrone.com
we would like to have a later that shows beautiful videos of drones
from all around the world. We would also like to show current live
drone videos, and to make a request to have videos shot at various
locations. We will also work to provide software so that drone
flights can be remotely controlled (within geobox and safetly
control guidlines) by remote people watching on WorldViews.

This project will make it easy to find people around any location
who can tell you about that location, show you things, or even
provide views or tours of the area. This works by listing current
live streams or guides ready to stream using Periscope, Meerkat,
or other mobile streaming technologies. We also have a ShareCamApp
powered by the JumpCh.at WebRTC system that lets people take pictures
together. The Registry lists active guides, or guides willing to
provide views for upcoming events, and for others to list views
or event coverage they would like to see.
