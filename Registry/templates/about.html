<h2>Mission</h2>
To support Humanity in peacefully sharing our world by making it easier to
connect, organize, share views of the world, and see ourselves as one family living
together on Earth.

&nbsp;<p>
&nbsp;<p>
This involves providing easy access to technologies that allow us to easily see other
parts of the world, and to share our own, in many exciting ways, such as live or recorded
images, video, and virtual models.   More importantly, it involves using those technologies
to help us connect, and to share our stories, concerns and dreams.
